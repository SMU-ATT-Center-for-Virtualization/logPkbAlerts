Figure out scheduled historic throughput/latency queries

	
	gets all iperf data from last 10 days

	groups by sending_region, receiving_region, ip_type, sending_thread_count, machine_type
	and gets avg/standard dev over last 10 days
	saves in table historic_* with entry_date as the current date

	changing all of these to include all regions in world



pkb_alerts table
	there seem to be duplicate entries
	I've removed existing duplicate entries

# TODO
	make sure additional duplicates aren't pushed to pkb_alerts table

	make another cloud function that creates alerts for throughput
	retroactively run function for past days

	add gartner_all to latency queries.
	*DONE* Need to change historic_latency to include machine_type column
	*DONE* Need to change all scheduled queries to write to machine_type column and select machine_type
	Need to change logPkbAlerts script to make sure it handle machine_type correctly

	Seems to be a problem in pkb_alerts where sample date is before hist_entry_date.
		I think this should not happen

	add machine_type and ip_type in pkb_alerts

	TODO make this command run after pkb_scheduler every time
		gsutil -m rsync -r /tmp/perfkitbenchmarker/runs/ gs://smu_pkb_run_logs

		OR better yet, figure out a different way to trigger this cloud function

	then delete logs

See if I can improve them
